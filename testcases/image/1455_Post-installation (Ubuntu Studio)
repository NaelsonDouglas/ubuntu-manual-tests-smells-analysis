<strong>Audio Check </strong>
Before you begin, make sure you are booted into a fresh session, and that you haven't opened any audio applications - including any browser pages with audio content.
<dl>
  <dt>Open qjackctl from the menu</dt>
    <dd>Start jack and confirm the jack starts in real time mode. Then stop jack to confirm it closes properly.</dd>
  <dt>Open Hydrogen from the menu</dt>
    <dd>Create a quick beat and play it - you should hear sound. If you aren't hearing any sound, make sure that connections are accurate in <strong>Qjackctl -> Connect</strong>, and that your hardware levels are not muted.</dd>
    <dd>See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudio/ProAudioIntro for more info on audio on Ubuntu Studio if you're having trouble. </dd>
    <dd>You can close Hydrogen once you are done</dd>
  <dt>Make sure pulseaudio is connected to jack</dt>
    <dd>In <strong>Qjackctl -> Connect</strong> make sure that pulseaudio sink and source exist.</dd>
  <dt>Open the pulseaudio mixer (pavucontrol).</dt>
   <dd>Set Pulseaudio to use jack in both "output devices" and "input devices"</dd>
  <dt>Test desktop sound through jack</dt>
    <dd>Open firefox and go to any page that has audio. Flash video will not work, so html5 is preferred - such as http://youtube.com/html5. </dd>
