<strong>Test Automatic Connectivity</strong>

Case ID: hcn-001

Using Unity
<dl>
    <dt>Ensure that Network Manager is running and that no networks are currently connected. (Network Manager icon, in the notification area. (Blank slice of pizza)</dt>
    <dt>Press the Super Windows Key or click on the Ubuntu logo on the Unity panel, and search Terminal , or select (Ctrl+Alt+T)</dt>
    <dt>Connect the network adapter to a network with a DHCP server. (However you connect to your wired network)</dt>
    <dt>After approximately 30 seconds, run ifconfig in the terminal. Verify that a cabled network device (e.g. '"eth0") is present and has received an IP address. Note the interface name (e.g. "eth0"). (The Network Manager icon should change to 2 solid arrows one pointing up, one down)</dt>
    <dt>In the terminal, run route -n. Note the IP address in the Gateway column. (not "0.0.0.0")</dt>
    <dt>In the terminal, run ping -c 5 [gateway] where [gateway] is the IP address of the Gateway, above.</dt> 
        <dd>Verify that the command reports "5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received".</dd>

<dl>
    <dt>In the terminal, run sudo ifconfig [interface] [staticIP] where [interface] is the interface name (e.g. eth0) and [staticIP] is a valid unused IP address on the current network. (If you are on a home network try using the previously used IP address, (still listed on the terminal) (Consult your network administrator if you do not know such an address.)</dt>
    <dt>In the terminal, run ifconfig. Verify that the network device is again listed (e.g. eth0) and has the IP address listed([staticIP]) as given above.</dt>
    <dt>In the terminal, run ping -c 5 [gateway] where [gateway] is the IP address of the Gateway, above.</dt> 
        <dd>Verify that the command reports "5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received".</dd>
        <dd>(In the terminal, run sudo ifconfig [interface] down where [interface] is the interface name above. This releases the static IP address back to the server. Then you will need to run sudo ifconfig [interface] up in order to enable your wired network and allow the server to assign an IP address as needed.) </dd>
